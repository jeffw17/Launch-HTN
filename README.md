# Launch-HTN

This is my first hackathon project that I made with my team at Hack The North 2020++. 

Launch is a platform for any student to post their project idea and connect with other students that want to build this passion project together. By using Launch, students are able to browse and choose a project that they are interested in and build up their portfolio with like-minded individuals. Students may also upload a project that they have in mind to search for people with specific skills or are also excited by their idea.
